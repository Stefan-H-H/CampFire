#GroupProject_jsonStatham_API
this repo is for the API, I ended up having to rearrange the .git repository, so it might be better to just delete the local repo and git clone again. If you lose access to your local branch from freshly git cloning, command `git branch -a` to see what we have available on the remote, and then `git checkout [branchname]` to create a local tracking branch.   
Our .git resided in the root folder, I created .git for api and ui respectively and pushed the changes. So I'd delete the root folder altogether, create an empty root folder and api/ui, and git clone in each directory. Then retrieve your branch in the api, and create a new branch in the UI (`git checkout -b [branchname]`)
