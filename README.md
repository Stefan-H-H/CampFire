# GroupProject_jsonStatham_API
this repo is for the API, I ended up having to rearrange the .git repository, so it might be better to just delete the local repo and git clone again. If you lose access to your local branch from freshly git cloning, command `git branch -a` to see what we have available on the remote, and then `git checkout [branchname]` to create a local tracking branch.   
Our .git resided in the root folder, I created .git for api and ui respectively and pushed the changes.
